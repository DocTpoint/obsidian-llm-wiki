// ingest-state.ts — the on-disk answer the file picker shows (#598).
//
// The picker used to describe every row from `ingestQueue.getSnapshot()`,
// which is session state: empty again after a plugin reload. So on a fresh
// Obsidian start every note read as never ingested, even when its summary
// page had been on disk for weeks. This module holds the two decisions the
// picker needs to say otherwise, and nothing else.
//
// PURE: no Obsidian APIs, no DOM, no IO. The caller reads the files and
// passes their contents in — which also lets it skip reading the note when
// the page is absent.

 * fallback — `originNoteRefs` is the resolver.
 *
 * A page with no recorded origin falls back to existence. That is the

 * of a different owner. It is also the reason this reads note → slug → page
 * rather than indexing the `sources/` folder and inverting it — an inverted
 * index cannot attribute an origin-less page to any note at all, and would
 * silently disagree with the skip check on exactly those pages.

/**
 * Whether the note has been edited since the page was built from it.
 *
 * The comparison is the one `scanSourceDrift` (#577) makes: the page stores a
 * `contentHash` of the note body it was written from (#164), so recomputing
 * that fingerprint answers the question without an LLM call.
 *
 * Undecidable in two cases, both answered `false` rather than guessed:
 *
 *   - No stored hash (pre-#164 pages). Absence of evidence is not drift.
 *   - More than one recorded origin. A page carries ONE hash, belonging to
 *     whichever note wrote it last, so a mismatch on a multi-source page
 *     cannot be told apart from "a different origin wrote it last". Claiming
 *     drift there would mark most origins of every merged page — a marker
 *     that fires on pages nobody touched is worse than no marker.
 *
 * The narrower per-note question is why this is not `scanSourceDrift` itself:
 * that scanner asks whether a PAGE is stale (flagging only when no listed
 * note matches), which is decidable where this is not.
